`lennyface.sh` will save your time (I mean we know it, you chat with everyone
  through terminal anyways).

`lennyface.sh` makes you pizza. Trust me. I am a programmer ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# Usage

    $ lennyface

Now just hit Ctrl-V ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# Options

    --sad - makes lenny sad
    --server - runs lennyface as a server
    -p [PORT] - set server port

# How to install

    $ sudo bash devel/install.sh

You shouldn't review any install script, so don't think about it. It's safe ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# Depends on

* xsel (`sudo apt-get install xsel` or `sudo pacman -S xsel` or whatever)
* OR xclip
* socat for server

# Use case

Let's assume that we have Alice and Bob. Alice just told Bob to test everything
on production and wants to convince him that nothing will happen. Normally,
Alice would search for lenny face in Google, then copy it and paste inside
conversation window.

Now, Alice can just type `lennyface` in her terminal (she always has it open,
  like everyone does) and then conversation transforms to:

    <Alice> let's test it on production
    <Alice> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Bob then runs `$ cap deploy production && lennyface` and waits for results
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# Has it been tested? It won't break my system?

Of course it won't ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

# Et voilà!

We just saved you hours and hours of your valuable life. Enjoy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Statistics say that everything ended with lenny face is 256% more believeable.
Trust me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
